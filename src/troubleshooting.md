# Troubleshooting

Here is a list of common issues and their solutions.

## Missing Access

If the bot reports an error about missing access, make sure it has all the permissions it needs to run.
Usually this is caused by the bot being unable to send messages in a channel.

More common problems will be listed as they are reported, so please report issues, if you encounter any, by [contacting us](/contact/).
